## Settings Overview

Open Settings with `Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,` or via **Quick Actions** (`Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`) → "Open Settings".

Settings are organized into tabs:

| Tab | Contents |
|-----|----------|
| **General** | Theme, input behavior, toggles defaults, context warnings, log level, storage location |
| **Shortcuts** | Customize keyboard shortcuts (see [Keyboard Shortcuts](./keyboard-shortcuts)) |
| **Appearance** | Font size, UI density |
| **Notifications** | Sound alerts, text-to-speech settings |
| **AI Commands** | View and edit slash commands and Spec-Kit prompts |

## Checking for Updates

Maestro checks for updates automatically on startup (configurable in Settings → General → **Check for updates on startup**).

**To manually check for updates:**
- **Quick Actions:** `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` → "Check for Updates"
- **Menu:** Click the hamburger menu (☰) → "Check for Updates"

When an update is available, you'll see:
- Current version and new version number
- Release notes summary
- **Download** button to get the latest release from GitHub
- Option to enable/disable automatic update checks

## Storage Location

Settings are stored in:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/maestro/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/maestro/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/maestro/`

## Cross-Device Sync (Beta)

Maestro can sync settings, sessions, and groups across multiple devices by storing them in a cloud-synced folder like iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive.

**Setup:**

1. Open **Settings** (`Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,`) → **General** tab
2. Scroll to **Storage Location**
3. Click **Choose Folder...** and select a synced folder:
   - **iCloud Drive**: `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Maestro`
   - **Dropbox**: `~/Dropbox/Maestro`
   - **OneDrive**: `~/OneDrive/Maestro`
4. Maestro will migrate your existing settings to the new location
5. Restart Maestro for changes to take effect
6. Repeat on your other devices, selecting the same synced folder

**What syncs:**
- Settings and preferences
- Session configurations
- Groups and organization
- Agent configurations
- Session origins and metadata

**What stays local:**
- Window size and position (device-specific)
- The bootstrap file that points to your sync location

**Important limitations:**
- **Single-device usage**: Only run Maestro on one device at a time. Running simultaneously on multiple devices can cause sync conflicts where the last write wins.
- **No conflict resolution**: If settings are modified on two devices before syncing completes, one set of changes will be lost.
- **Restart required**: Changes to storage location require an app restart to take effect.

To reset to the default location, click **Use Default** in the Storage Location settings.
